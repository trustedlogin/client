## 1.3.4 (2022-10-11)

  - Removed second argument from the `SupportUser::get_revoke_url()` method (`$current_url`)

## 1.1 (2021-12-13)

- Improved admin menu configuration
  - Enhanced logic around whether and how to add a TrustedLogin menu to the sidebar depending on the `menu/slug` setting:
    - If `null`, the a top-level menu will be added.
    - If `false`, a menu item will not be added.
    - If a string, the `menu/slug` setting will be used as the `$parent_slug` argument passed to the [`add_submenu_page()` function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_submenu_page/)
  - Added `menu/icon_url` setting that is used as the `$icon_url` parameter in [`add_menu_page()` function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_menu_page/)
- If granting access fails, the reference ID is now passed onto the support URL using the `?ref=` query parameter
- Removed third arguments for `trustedlogin/{ns}/template/auth` and `'trustedlogin/{ns}/template/auth/footer_links` filters, since the namespace is already known
- Improved WordPress backward-compatibility by removing usage of:
  - `wp_date()` (added in WordPress 5.3); used `DateTime` instead
  - `wp_clear_scheduled_hook()` (added in WP 4.9); used `wp_clear_scheduled_hook()` instead
- Fixed filter naming: `trustedlogin/{ns}/public_key` renamed to `trustedlogin/{ns}/vendor_public_key`

## 1.0.2 (2021-10-07)
